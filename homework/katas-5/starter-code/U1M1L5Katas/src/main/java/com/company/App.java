//1. Define and implement the following methods in that file:
//
//        - **Subtract Two**: Create a method called `subtract` that takes two int parameters (a and b) and returns the value of b subtracted from a.
//        - **Subtract or Zero**: Create a method called `subtractOrZero` that takes two int parameters (a and b) and returns the value of b subtracted from a, unless the result is less than zero, in which case, return 0.
//        - **Max**: Create a method called `max` that takes three int parameters (a, b, and c) and returns the value of the largest of the three.
//        - **Min**: Create a method called `min` that takes three int parameters (a, b, and c) and returns the value of the smallest of the three.
//        - **isLarger**: Create a method called `isLarger` that takes two int parameters (first and second) and returns true if the first is greater than second.
